                        Hello! My name is George, and I am currently studying Information Technology at <a href="https://gmu.edu">George Mason University.</a>
                        I'm  an extremely driven student, and I am super passionate particularly about Cybersecurity. My fascination in this field mostly boils
                        down to my love of helping others. In the past, I've participated in events such as computer repair clinics, to giving presentations on
                        internet safety. My goal is to improve the overall global cyber posture, as I've learned from experience that cybersecurity is often an
                        afterthought to most. I'm extremely outgoing and love working with groups - I love people - and I'm extremely extroverted. Nice to meet you!
